Staying informed in 2026 without being overwhelmed is a daunting task. I have tried many methods from RSS readers to fully going print media. However, I recently found an imperfect flow that let me read the news on my Kobo, and it is my favorite solution so far.

### Starting with RSS
I tried both [Inoreader](https://www.inoreader.com/) and [Feedly](https://feedly.com/), through them I subscribed to news sources and tech blogs. This worked pretty well. I could keep up to date with local, national, and tech news in one place! However, the feed became overwhelming, I lost track or articles, and I wanted to get away from staring at a screen. This coincided with a wanting to be more *offline*, so I subscribed to print magazines and newspapers.

### Switching to Print
I subscribed to the [Chicago Sun-Times](https://chicago.suntimes.com/), [The Economist](https://www.economist.com/), and [Wired Magazine](https://www.wired.com/). I stuck with this for a while, but then a few issues started emerging: 

1. I read less tech blogs or independent media that can only be found online. 
2. Reading paper magazine or newspapers in public is inconvenient. 
3. I would fall behind the latest news, and collected a large backlog of magazines and newspapers.  

I did not entirely give this up. I kept and renewed my Chicago Sun-Times paper subscription, because I like getting the newspaper in the morning.

### Instapaper

Ironically, I found out about [Instapaper](https://www.instapaper.com/) because it emerged as a replacement after the death of [Pocket](https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/future-of-pocket). I saw that Kobo started supporting an Instapaper account integration. I setup an  Instapaper account and started saving articles via the browser extension and through the Instapaper app, and they seamlessly appeared on my Kobo. 


### Inoreader -> Instapaper -> Kobo

So here it goes! Throughout the day, I'll scroll through Inoreader (that has blogs and news accounts I subscribe to), read [news.ycombinator.com](https://news.ycombinator.com/), or receive a shared article from a friend and I will save that to my Instapaper account. Then when I have some downtime, I'll sync my Kobo and scroll through and read the articles at my leisure. It is a more sane way to consume the news and easier on the eyes.
