**Software Developer / Cloud Engineer - Chicago, Illinois** 

I am a software developer with over 5 years of experience. I have written programs in C#, JavaScript, and PowerShell. More recently I have worked in Azure, Cloudflare, and HAProxy. I am currently learning Rust.

I graduated from DePaul University with a degree in Computer Science and a minor in Physics. 

In my free time I enjoy reading, running, and spending time outdoors.
